# Fantasy-Manager

Declaration: This is a program of a self-implemented game similar to "Fantasy Basketball Manager", I build this program solely to practice my  programming skills.
----

How to run the program?
--------
Run <b>Myserver.java</b> in the /server folder, which should create a game server handle the game.  
Run <b>Main.java</b> in /Basketballmanager/main/start folder, which should initiate a client.  
Right now the server listens to port 9090 and client connects to port 9090 with ip address 127.0.0.1, which means you need to run the game locally, and start 2 clients in the same computer.  
If you want to change it, please goto <b>Myclient.java</b> in /Basketballmanager/client, class Myclient, method run.
